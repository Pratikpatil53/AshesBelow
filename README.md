# 🕯️ Ashes Below

**Ashes Below** is a first-person psychological horror game about isolation, corruption, and forgotten places.  
Built using Unreal Engine, this is my first indie horror project.

> "You’re a detective. No badge. No backup. Just a tip from a friend. People are disappearing, and the forest is hiding something far worse than rumors."_

## 🧠 About the Game

Ashes Below follows a lone detective who enters a remote forest after receiving a warning about missing people. With local police ignoring the case, and corruption running deep, you’re on your own.  
Explore decaying sewers, and finally a crumbling asylum where something—or someone—waits.

This is a solo-developed project created to learn Unreal Engine and experiment with horror design and atmosphere.
